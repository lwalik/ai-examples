  Okay, the user is asking how much 2 multiplied by 2 is. Let me think. Well, 2 times 2...
  I remember that when you multiply two numbers, you just do the calculation.
  So 2 multiplied by 2. Let me do that step by step. First, 2 times 2 is 4.
  So the answer should be 4. I don't think there's any trick here, right? No need to round or anything.
  Just a straightforward multiplication. Yep, that's it.\n\n`);
